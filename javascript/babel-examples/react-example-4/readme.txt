VS Code Setup:
Open the HTML file in VS Code’s Live Server extension for real-time previews:
Install Live Server (ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Right-click the HTML file and select Open with Live Server.

If working in the React submodule, ensure package.json and Node.js are set up for full React development, as Babel standalone isn’t needed in a typical create-react-app or Vite setup.
